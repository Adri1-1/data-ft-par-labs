## Project Description

"Simulator" of Blackjack game

## Rules

One player attempt to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21. It’s up to each individual player if an Ace is worth 1 or 11. Face cards are 10 and any other cards is its pip value. 

## Workflow

At every turn, a player receive 2 cards revealed, and a dealer receive one hidden card and one card revealed. Compare the values each player’s cards and dealer card. If a player have a blackjack, he win immediately. If not, he chooses between getting a new card or keeping only the two cards. If i get one card, values of him cards change, if it’s BlackJack, he win, if it’s a value above 21, he lose, or else he still have a choice to getting a card or discover a second card of the dealer. He can only draw 5 cards. Every time the deck has less than 20 cards it is shuffled again.
